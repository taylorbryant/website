For the past year, I have been using an extension called [CSScomb](http://csscomb.com/) to keep my CSS clean and consistent based on my own taste.

CSScomb is a formatter for CSS that can be installed as an extension on most popular text editors, including [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It allows you to stop worrying about how your CSS looks and focus on the code. In this post, I will go over how to install and set up CSScomb.

_Note: I use VS Code on macOS. However, these same principles apply to other text editors._

## Install CSScomb

Installing CSScomb is very easy. See below.

## Create a custom config file

You can create a custom config on CSScomb's own generator [here](http://csscomb.com/config). The generator will show you 24 different CSS examples, ask you to pick which formatting you prefer out of the available options, and spit out a chunk of key-value pairs.

Once you've run through the generator, copy and paste the key-value pairs into your text editor and save them in a file named `.csscomb.json`.

## Use a config file

Place your custom config file (or [my example config](https://gist.github.com/taylorbryant/1041b80df41a942835942d8351eabb3d)) in `~/.vscode/`. By default, `.vscode` will be hidden. One quick way to find it is to type `~/.vscode/` in Spotlight search.

Now, let's put this file to use:

- Go to **Code** > **Preferences** > **Settings** or press `⌘` + `,` to open the settings window
- Paste the following key-value pair in **User Settings**: `"csscomb.preset": "~/.vscode/your-config.csscomb.json",`
- Replace `your-config.csscomb.json` with your own config's filename
- Press `⌘` + `S` to save the changes to the file

## Use CSScomb

Open the command palette by navigating to **View** > **Command Palette...** or press `Shift` + `⌘` + `P`. In the command palette window, type `format` and click **CSSComb: Format Styles**.
